      <h1>My favorite stuff</h1>
      <h2>Anime</h2>

      <p>I have been a huge anime fan since 2006
        and i have taken a liking to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shingeki no kyoji</li>
        <li>Naruto</li>
        <li>Bleach</li>
        <li>boku no hero academia</li>


      <h2>Animals</h2>

      <p>Am quite passionate about the iwld exotic breeds of animals we find in
        rainforsests like the Amazon</p>

      <h3>Video games</h3>

      <p>Although most people argue that video games are a waste of time and make
        people dummier,I think that actually games make people smarter as they t
        accomplish levels use problem solving skills</p>
